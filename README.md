### Excellence

Student instructions
====================

Introduction
------------

This assessment activity requires you to construct and test a mobile app that
will be the beginning of an RPG game, you are required to just create the
character creation section of the game.

You will be assessed on how effectively you refine your program to ensure that
the program:

-   is a well-structured, logical response to the task

-   has been comprehensively tested and debugged

-   is flexible and robust. Examples of this could include;

-   using actions, conditions, control structures and methods, functions, or
    procedures effectively

-   checking input data for validity

-   correctly handling expected, boundary and invalid cases

-   using constants, variables and derived values in place of literals.

When developing your program, you must ensure your program:

-   uses variables storing at least two types of data (e.g. numeric, text,
    Boolean)

-   uses sequence, selection and iteration control structures

-   takes input from a user and produces output

-   follows common conventions of the chosen programming language

-   is documented with appropriate variable/function names and comments that
    describe the code function and behaviour.

Your program must use two or more advanced programming techniques. Examples of
advanced programming techniques include writing code that:

-   modifies data stored in collections (e.g. lists, arrays, dictionaries)

-   defines and manipulates multidimensional data in collections

-   creates methods, functions, or procedures that use parameters and/or return
    values

-   responds to events generated by a graphical user interface (GUI)

-   requires non-basic string manipulation

-   uses functionality of additional non-core libraries.

This is an **individual assessment** activity. You will have until the end of
term one (in-class time and out-of-class time) to complete it, it will be due in
your last class of term 1.

Task
----

CSC Gaming has contracted you to create the character creation section of an up
and coming RPG game. They have provided you with the character graphics, but
would like you create a proof of concept of how the character creation process
might work.

### Specifications

Your character creation section must meet the following specifications:

1.  Allow the user to select from 5 different types of clothing; this should
    include;

    1.  Buttons to scroll to the previous and next item of clothing

    2.  Text displaying the current selection

    3.  Information about each item of clothing needs to be stored in a table

        1.  Note: This same list will be used to load the images for items of
            clothing, so spelling and case are important

2.  A way for the user to select the characters gender.

3.  Have an area where the user can enter the following text;

    1.  Characters name.

        1.  This should be between 3 and 15 characters inclusive.

        2.  (optional) Not start with any numbers or special characters.

            1.  <https://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/data/luaString/index.html>

        3.  Display appropriate feedback if the user enters an invalid name.

    2.  Character’s strength

        1.  CSC Gaming has requested this be between 1 and 100 inclusive

        2.  Display appropriate feedback if the user enters an invalid strength.

4.  Have a button that the user will press that will proceed to the next
    section.

5.  When that button is pressed, the following will be displayed.

    1.  A title for the character screen (your choice)

    2.  The characters name.

    3.  Change the characters head depending on the gender of the final
        character.

    4.  The character wearing the appropriate clothing.

        1.  You will need to place these all on the screen in the correct
            location

    5.  The characters hit points displayed in an appropriate way. This should
        be calculated using the following formula;

        1.  Hitpoints = strength \* 10 / 1.3

### Development

You should break the program up into components or stages (at least 4), you will
need to save a separate copy of your code at the end of each stage. Think about
what information each component will need to do its job, and what information it
will pass on to the rest of the program. Code, test and debug each component
separately. As you complete each section you should save your code with a new
version number.

**Note**: To test a program in a comprehensive way, you should think about how
you will test the program for various cases such as expected, boundary and
unexpected input. It is often useful to note down what you want to test and what
you expect to happen, as well as what actually happened. Testing can be
demonstrated by making a brief screencast showing the program being
comprehensively tested. If desired, you can take screenshots of your screencast
and annotate them.

Ensure that you comment your code appropriately as you develop it and use
variable/function names and comments that describe code function and behaviour.

Ensure that you have followed conventions and that your program is a
well-structured, logical response to the task.

You should ensure that your code is robust and that it handles expected,
boundary and invalid cases.

Wherever possible you should try to ensure that your code has a flexible
structure to allow for continued development.

### Conventions

Make sure you name all variables correctly

-   Make sure all variables have an appropriate meaningful name

-   Variables and functions: be consistent with your use of camelCase or
    under_scores

-   Constants: UPPER_WITH_UNDER

Commenting

-   Use a space after the //, first word capitalized, use a full sentence ending
    in a period, indent to the same level as the code it's describing

-   Be included where appropriate e.g. at the beginning of every function and
    before complicated bits of code

-   Should describe code function and behaviour

Images

-   If you are using your own images, then you should reduce the size of the
    image BEFORE you include it in Corona.

-   Make sure all images have a transparent background

Code Layout

-   Make sure your code is tabbed out correctly to make it easier to read

-   Spread your code out so it is easier to read

DRY Code

-   Make sure you limit the amount of repetition in your code

Backups

-   Make sure you take a copy of your code at the end of each planned section

Extensions
----------

You could also implement the following, these do **NOT** need to be done, and
you can gain an Excellence grade **WITHOUT** including these options, however by
doing these you might be able to provide more evidence of your skills:

-   Include the option to go back and change choices

-   Option to reset the current selection

-   Improve the way the picker works

Hand in
=======

-   An electronic version of your programs. This will include all your versions
    and final code.

-   Your testing log describing how you tested your program and any problems you
    encountered (see resource page for an example)

how My testing Will be presented.

-   Two different data types

-   iteration control structure

-   selection

-   input from the user and output of the designed player

-   AND two or more advanced techniques, such as:

-   functions that take input parameters

-   event handling code to respond to events from the GUI

-   a table “dictionary” for the clothing images and selection.

The examples above are indicative samples only. Final grades will be decided
using professional judgement based on a holistic examination of the evidence
provided against the criteria in the Achievement Standard.

| Written code for a program that performs a specified task. *For example (partial evidence): The program meets all of the specified task requirements for the Player Profile Picker. The program includes:*                                                                                                 | Followed common conventions for the chosen programming language *For example (partial evidence): The student uses all lower case variable names for code written in Lua. Function definitions are placed before the main function, as per the programming language. Layout conventions are followed. Indentation and/or bracketing conventions are followed as per the programming language. The student has used an automated tool to check that their code follows common conventions.*                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Ensured that the program is a well-structured, logical response to the task Made the program flexible and robust *For example (partial evidence): Functions have been used to avoid repeated code. It is easy to extend the functionality of the code (e.g. a function has been used to check choices, so it would be easy to update the menu to add or delete another item of clothing). They have used derived values (e.g. \#shirts to iterate through a table instead of hard coded values.*  *Constants are used as required when a value never changes e.g. full width, strength limits*  *Students have used variables of appropriate scope (e.g. the variable storing the name should be declared as Local and not global).* |

| Tested and debugged the program to ensure that it works on a sample of expected cases *For example (partial evidence): Student has provided evidence of testing their program. The testing has been completed for expected cases, but the program may have bugs when boundary or invalid data is entered.* | Tested and debugged the program effectively to ensure that it works on a sample of both expected and relevant boundary cases. *For example (partial evidence): The student has evidence of testing and corresponding debugging of their program to confirm that it works correctly on a range of values, including boundary values. They have documented the development of their program using a testing log or version updates. Evidence has been collected to show that the program reacts correctly to an incorrect name or strength value, and the testing debugging ensured the program works on boundary cases, e.g. the program has been tested on strengths of 0, 1, 100 and 101.* | Comprehensively tested and debugged the program. *For example (partial evidence): The student has supplied test plans and/or annotated screenshots/a screenshot showing that the program components (and final program) have been tested to ensure that it works correctly for expected cases, boundary and unexpected or invalid cases. They have used others to test their program throughout the development process and have refined their final program based upon testing.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

-   *variables that store two different data types (e.g. string for name and
    Boolean for delivery)*

-   *iteration control structure (e.g. a loop that repeats the entry prompt)*

-   *selection (e.g. condition based on the users choices)*

-   *input from the user and output of the designed player*

-   *AND two or more advanced techniques, such as:*

-   *functions/procedures/methods for the ordering process and menu display that
    take input parameters*

-   *event handling code to respond to events from the GUI*

-   *a table “dictionary” for the clothing images and selection.*
